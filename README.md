A basic GitHub repository example for Call for Code submissions and those projects that join the Code and Response initiative. Not all sections or files are required. You can make this as simple or as in-depth as you need.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Communication during a crisis is critical for keeping people and organizations informed about unfolding events, available resources, and coordinated activities. The success of crisis management depends on accurate and up to date information from trusted sources. In modern age access to information is not an issue - instead, there is an information overload that takes a lot of time and effort in order to find a short and accurate answer one is looking for. How do we find answers to similar questions that have different meanings depending on the context and intent of the question?

### How can technology help?

A smart crisis communication Chatbot can help with important questions that have almost unique well-defined answers. It can also provide access to a credible knowledge base collection from which AI systems can draw answers and could learn from the overall Q&A process. However, a Chatbot interface is not suitable for follow-up in-depth research. Furthermore,  training a chatbot may be biassed by the programmer's own way of posing questions.

### The idea

Utilizing a web-page interface to answer COVID-19 related questions by experts and the general public with clear intent and context can help build a knowledge datasets with proper focus and continuously improving the training of an AI system. The answers to the most frequent questions within each sub-category will be built into a Watson Assistant Chatbot with a relevant intent while the less frequent questions will be addressed by the Watson Discovery AI engine.

## The architecture

![CovidScholar Architecture](https://github.com/VGGatGitHub/covidscholar/blob/master/CovidScholar%20Architecture.png)

1. The user navigates to the *CovidScholar* web site to pose questions and to interact with the frontend.
2. Based on the selected knowledge database a list of answers is generated by the Watson Discovery engine.
3. The user is presented with the best possible answers along with relevant classification labels related to concepts and entities.
4. The subsequent user behavior informs the AI on the relevance of the answers obtained.
5. The queries and answers are recorded and utilized for continuous AI training.


Post-processing: The most frequent questions with clear unique answers are grouped into similarity sets and utilized via a Watson Assistant Chatbot for broader access and dissemination.

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](roadmap.jpg)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Live demo

You can find a running system to test at [Biosight](https://marketengine.parts/biosight)
